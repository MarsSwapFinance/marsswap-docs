# Tokenomics

## **Emission Rate:**

* 0.3 MARS per Block \(~8400 MARS/Day\).
* Reward halving every 6 months.
* MARS will be burnt every 6 hours. The amount will be relative to the deposits on farms & pools.

## **Enhanced burning mechanisms**

In order to ensure the sustainability of the project, and to maintain MARS' price stable, we created a strong burning mechanism:

* A fixed 3.95% deposit fee is set up for all non-MARS Farms and Pools. **100% of this fee will be burned** in order to maintain MARS's price stability. MarsSwap will not profit from this deposit fee, given that it will be burned in it's totality.
* **Recurrent automatic burn** for users with non-referrals \(2% burn\).

## **Fair Launch**

From day 1 we are committed to launching a protocol that is as fair and inclusive as possible, ensuring that both small and big players can benefit from the protocol in the same way.  
MarsSwap will accomplish this by realizing a presale of 100% of the MARS tokens initial supply.

Initial minting: 125,000 MARS.  
There is no private token sale, and no dev team allocation.  
  
**Initial MARS supply allocation and distribution:**

* 100,000 MARS sold at a fixed price to ensure fairness.
* 25,000 MARS will be used for liquidity and this will never be removed.
  * 50% in MARS-BUSD LP \(locked forever\).
  * 50% in MARS-BNB LP \(locked forever\).

### 

### Pre-sale fund allocation:

The funds proceeding from the 100,000 MARS distributed via the pre-sale process will be allocated as follows:

* 25% of the total fund will be used to provide liquidity, and will never be removed:
  * 50% in MARS-BUSD LP \(locked forever\).
  * 50% in MARS-BNB LP \(locked forever\).
* 50% will be used to make new hirings, grow the team and develop MarsSwap's ambitious [roadmap](https://docs.marsswap.finance/roadmap) and integrating with 1INCH, among other popular dex aggregators.
* 15% will be used for marketing, community management and design efforts.
* 10% will be used to establish mid- and long-term partnerships with other platforms which leverage MarsSwap's features.



To ensure safety of liquidity and funds, and to discourage liquidity bots and hinder whale participation, the sale processes will be conducted in conjunction with a platform specialized in pre-sales and IPOs.

In the event that any MARS are left unsold, they will be burnt. **The dev team will keep no MARS. We will participate in the presale process like everyone else.**

## Platform Development and Sustainability

MarsSwap's development team will only profit from the fees when users make transactions and operations in the platform. This fee is denominated in MARS.  
Having zero initial token allocation, this fee is how MarsSwap's Team is going to start earning MARS tokens.

  
Implementing this approach ensures a safe, stable and healthy platform for all users:

* Reduces to zero the possibility that the dev team can just dump the tokens the day after the presale, as seen regularly in the crypto space.
* The dev team can't just leave the project live, forget it and stop working on it. In order to make a profit, we need to work and evolve this platform to the point we envision.
