# Tokenomics

## **Emission Rate:**

* 0.3 MARS per Block \(~8400 MARS/Day\).
* Reward halving every 6 months. Proposal via Governance.
* MARS will be burnt on a regular schedule. The amount will be relative to the deposits on farms & pools.

## **Launch & Sale Schema**

To ensure that both small and big players can benefit from the protocol in the same way, MarsSwap will perform a presale of 100% of the MARS tokens initial supply.

Initial minting: 1,150,000 MARS.  
There is no private token sale, and no dev fund, or team allocation.  
  
**Initial MARS supply allocation and distribution:**

* 1,000,000 MARS sold at a fixed price to ensure fairness.
* 150,000 MARS will be used for liquidity and this will never be removed.
  * 100% allocated in MARS-BNB LP \(locked forever\).

### 

### Pre-sale fund allocation:

The funds proceeding from the 1,000,000 MARS distributed via the pre-sale process will be allocated as follows:

* 15% of the total fund will be used to provide MARS-BNB LP liquidity in MarsSwap's AMM, and will never be removed.
* 50% will be used to make new hirings, grow the team and develop MarsSwap's ambitious [roadmap](https://docs.marsswap.finance/roadmap) and integrating with 1INCH, among other popular dex aggregators.
* 25% will be used for marketing, community management and design efforts.
* 10% will be used to establish mid- and long-term partnerships with other platforms which leverage MarsSwap's features.



To ensure safety of liquidity and funds, and to discourage liquidity bots and hinder whale participation, the sale processes will be conducted in conjunction with a platform specialised in pre-sales and IPOs.

In the event that any MARS are left unsold, 100% of the remaining MARS Tokens will be burned. **The dev team will keep no MARS. We will participate in the presale process like everyone else.**

## Platform Development and Sustainability

MarsSwap's development team will only profit from the fees when users make transactions and operations in the platform. This fee is denominated in MARS.  
Having zero initial token allocation, this fee is how MarsSwap's Team is going to start earning MARS tokens.

  
Implementing this approach ensures a safe, stable and healthy platform for all users:

* Reduces to zero the possibility that the dev team can just dump the tokens the day after the presale, as seen regularly in the crypto space.
* The dev team can't just leave the project live, forget it and stop working on it. In order to make a profit, the dev team needs to work and evolve the platform to the point of envision.
