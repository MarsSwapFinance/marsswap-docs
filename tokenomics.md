# Tokenomics

## **Emission Rate:**

* Total Supply: 10M.
* 0.3 MARS per Block \(~8400 MARS/Day\).
* Reward halving every 6 months.
* MARS will be burnt every 6 hours. The amount will be relative to the deposits on farms & pools.

## **Stability-focused Burning mechanism**

In order to ensure the sustainability of the project, and to maintain MARS' price stable, we created a strong burning mechanism: a fixed 3.95% deposit fee is set up for all non-MARS Farms and Pools. 100% of this fee will be burned in order to maintain MARS's price stability. MarsSwap will not profit from this deposit fee, given that it will be burned in it's totallity.

## **Fair Launch**

From day 1 we are committed to launching a protocol that is as fair and inclusive as possible, ensuring that both small and big players can benefit from the protocol in the same way. MarsSwap will accomplish this by realizing a presale of 100% of the MARS tokens initial supply.

Our initial minting will be of 135,000 MARS, which will be sold at a fixed price to ensure fairness.

In order to avoid liquidity bots, and to maximize exposure, MARS' sale process will be performed according to the following schema:

* 35,000 MARS will be locked in order to provide initial liquidity to MarsSwap's LPs,
* 25,000 MARS will be distributed in an initial pre-sale,
* 75,000 MARS will be sold in a public offering.

To ensure safety of liquidity and funds, and to discourage liquidity bot participation, both sale processes will be conducted in conjunction with platforms specialized in pre-sales and IPOs.

In the event that any MARS are left unsold, they will be burnt. **The dev team will keep no MARS. We will participate in the presale process like everyone else.**
