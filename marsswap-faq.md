### FAQ

#### What makes MarsSwap Finance different from other Farms and Pools?

We are trying to solve a real problem: Currently, access to traditional markets is not available to everyone as it should be. Thanks to BSC we will allow everyone to trade, farm and gain exposure to real-world tradeable assets \(in the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Tesla\) on an accessible, cheap and transparent way.



#### When launch?

We've just finished developing MarsSwap core features, which was our main focus up until now. Now that the technical part is 100% functional, both our whitepaper, dApp, and contract code are being peer reviewed.

We are finishing the last details in regards of pre-sale and fair launch strategies, which will be taking place anytime soon.

#### So, you're like Robinhood for Crypto?

Exactly! But, unlike Robinhood, the MarsSwap Protocol is fully decentralized. This means that we won't \(or even can\) stop trading on a stock or asset just because our friends are loosing money.

i.e: When GME stock trading was halted, you would have been able to use MarsSwap to trade it, regardless of the policies applied by external entities.  

#### How are the trades backed?. If most users are long one instrument, who is holding up the other side of the trade?

MarsSwap's initial version we will make use of the Mirror protocol. All assets farmed on MarsSwap can be bridged and traded 1 to 1 with Mirror assets.

For instance, you can get mTSLA on Mirror ETH in order to bridge it and farm it on MarsSwap, taking advantage of BSC's super low gas cost and fast transaction times.

#### Do you need to have an agreement with Mirror in order to leverage Synthetic Assets?

No, we don't. But that's what DeFi is all about. We can interact with any contract on the network to build on top of them. The same way Autofarm leverages and builds on top of other farm projects, without necessarily requiring partnerships.

#### How will MarsSwap's protocol evolve over time?

By implementing MarsSwap's Governance solution, MARS holders will be able to vote and decide on the evolution of the protocol.
Governance-based upgrades take place involving three main components: the MARS token, the governance module, and a Timelock contract.

Upgrades via Governance can take two different shapes:
* Any *minor* updates and changes to MarsSwaps' curret setup (i.e: updating Fees) will be __proposed by MARS holders__. Once a new proposal is submitted, the voting process will take place among MARS holders.
* Any major upgrades to MarsSwap's protocol (i.e: the eventual migration to MasterPlanetv2 in order to enable some of the advanced features in the Roadmap) will be __proposed by the dev team__, who will provide both the proposed changes and extensive documentation regarding major changes and possible impacts. Once a new proposal is submitted, the voting process will take place among MARS holders.
