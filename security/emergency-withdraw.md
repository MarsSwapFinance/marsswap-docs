# Emergency Withdraw

Our MasterPlanet contract has an Emergency Withdraw function that can be executed directly from BSCscan. This can be helpful in the case of a DDoS attack where the website could become inaccessible. Again, we significantly reduced the chances of such an attack by deploying exclusively on GitHub pages and having no custom servers.
