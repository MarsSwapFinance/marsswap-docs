# Timelock Contract

We use a Timelock smart contract which adds a 6-hour delay for all the functions that the deployer could execute on the MasterPlanet contract. After a week, the time delay will be increased to 12 hours.

Every time we execute a function, a public transaction will be created and will be visible for everyone. But the transaction wonâ€™t take effect until the delay is over. We will publish in our communities every transaction we execute.
