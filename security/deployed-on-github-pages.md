# Deployed on GitHub Pages

During the last few months, there were multiple attacks and scams on the clients of decentralized applications, both internal and external. Many yield farms increased the APRs on their clients to attract investors, who only realize the scam after they had paid deposit fees. Clients deployed on custom servers can also be compromised, and unaware investors might end up losing their deposits. Just a few weeks ago, both PancakeSwap and Cream Finance suffered DNS hijack attacks.

By deploying on GitHub Pages with a public repository, we give our community the ability to verify how data is calculated and displayed. Also, it increases our security since there are no custom servers at all.
