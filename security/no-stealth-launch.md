# No Stealth Launch

Many yield farm projects make an early private launch of the farms. This allows a few selected to get all the benefits and then dump all the tokens as soon as the farms become public.

MarsSwap will have a no-stealth launch schema:  
All farms will be open to everyone simultaneously, and time times will be published with anticipation on our communities. We want everyone to have the same opportunities, and we want the platform and the users to grow together.
