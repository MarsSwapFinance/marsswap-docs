# Flash Loans

MarsSwap has native support for Flash Loans from day one. Flash loans allow you to withdraw up to the total reserves of any token on MarsSwap and execute arbitrary logic at no upfront cost, provided that by the end of the transaction, you either:

* pay for the withdrawn tokens with the corresponding pair tokens
* return the withdrawn tokens along with a small fee

Flash loans are incredibly useful because they obviate upfront capital requirements and unnecessary order-of-operations constraints for multi-step transactions involving MarsSwap.

Flash loans will allow users to benefit from arbitrage opportunities, which will help keep the prices of the synthetic assets in line with the real assets while also increasing the number of transactions and rewards for liquidity providers.
