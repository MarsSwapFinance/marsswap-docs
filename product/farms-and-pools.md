# Farms & Pools

There will be 10 pools & farms at launch. These will include 3 synthetic assets: Apple \(mAAPL\), Microsoft \(mMSFT\), and Amazon \(mAMZN\).

Every 3 days, we will launch a new synthetic asset. Each one will have its own LP Farm and single token Pool.

MarsSwap also provides an enhanced price oracle that accumulates the two assets’ relative prices at the beginning of each block. This allows other contracts on BSC to estimate the time-weighted average price for the two assets over arbitrary intervals.

In order to reward those investors who are taking a higher risk, farms on MarsSwap will have a higher APR than pools. By staking your tokens in the farms, you might face the risk of [Impermanent Loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained).
